# kremstream-neo

My new twitch overlay engine. Heavy work in progress.
Based on: [krem-bun](https://github.com/Rosalina121/krem-bun)

This will work in similar way (same technologies duh), but will be more maintainable

Old project still works, it's just too janky, so decided to start from scratch

To install:

```bash
bun i
```

(You may have to also run it in /overlays/primo etc... dirs as well, they're separate React frontends)


To run:

```bash
bun build:overlays
bun start
```
